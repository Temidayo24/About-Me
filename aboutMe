I am a budding Front-End Developer living in Lagos, Nigeria. Honestly, it's been a year of dilly-dallying in and out of Tech, but I am hoping this passion and dedication has come to stay this time.

I currently work as an IT Service Desk Analyst and I am looking forward to switching to the Software Development field of IT in a couple of months to a year.

I am a problem solver and I have a keen eye for details. Collaborating with and in a team is also one of my strengths.

I am 100% interested in the entire frontend spectrum and working on projects with positive people.
